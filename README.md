# Cloud Computing Basics (Cloud 101)

This repository has been created for academic use but feel free to use it. 
The course is not a fast paced course and informative so i suggest you watching the videos and answering the quiz as soon as you are done.
The course is about cloud computing: what it is, what it supports, and how it is delivered. and progresses to Cloud economics, levels of managed infrastructure, and Azure services before comparing some of the cloud platforms and discuss the future of cloud computing.
The questions in the quizzes are very easy so please try to answer them yourself before looking at the answers.
Lastly, i would like to thank Learn Quest and Prof. Jim Sullivan for this wonderful and easy to understand beginners course on cloud computing.
